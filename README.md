This is a basic authentication boilerplate using react, graphcool, and auth0 ðŸŽ‰

* Copy the .env.template file and create a .env
* Set these values appropriately
* yarn in the root directory
* cd into the server folder and yarn there too
* run export AUTH0_DOMAIN=yourcooldomain
* run export AUTH0_API_IDENTIFIER=yourcoolidentifier
* (Need to use the .env if possible instead of exporting... I couldn't figure it out)
* npm i -g graphcool-framework
